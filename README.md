## Introduction
This typically covers the basic concepts of algorithms and data structures, their importance in computing, complexity analysis, and Big O notation.

## Sorting methods
These include algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort, each with its own strategy for arranging data in a particular order.

## Tree data structure
- Tree traversals involve visiting all the nodes of a tree systematically. Pre-order, in-order, and post-order are types of depth-first traversals.
- In-Fix to Post-Fix conversion is used in expression evaluation in compilers.
- Post-Fix to Expression tree conversion is used to create a tree representation of arithmetic expressions.
- Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree where each node has at most two children and the left child is less than the parent and the right is greater.
- Self-balancing trees like AVL and Red-Black trees automatically keep themselves balanced to ensure operations like insert, delete, and find remain efficient.
- M-way trees are generalizations of binary trees that can have more than two children.

## Hashing
Hashing techniques are used to implement associative arrays, handling collisions through methods like open addressing and separate chaining.

## Greedy Algorithms
Greedy Algorithms like Dijkstra’s for shortest paths, Prim’s and Kruskal’s for minimum spanning trees, find a local optimum with the hope of finding a global optimum.

## Backtracking algorithms
Backtracking algorithms solve problems incrementally, removing solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints. Branch and bound is an optimization strategy for solving combinatorial problems.

## Assignment Problem
Hungarian method is a combinatorial optimization algorithm that solves the assignment problem in polynomial time.

## String manipulation
- Brute force is a straightforward method of solving problems that tries every possibility.
- Boyer- Moore is an efficient string searching algorithm.
- Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) improves the brute force method by avoiding redundant searches.
- Rabin-Karp uses hashing to find any one of a set of pattern strings in a text.

## Heap sort
Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on a binary heap data structure.

## Huffman coding
Huffman coding is a popular encoding method used for data compression, which uses variable-length codes to represent characters based on their frequencies.
