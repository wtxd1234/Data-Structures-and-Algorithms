# Chapter 1: Introduction
## 1.1 Algorithms as opposed to programs
- algorithm: a finite sequence of instructions, each of which has a clear meaning and can be performed with a finite amount of effort in a finite length of time
    - Imperative Programming: computation in terms of instructions that change the program/data state
    - Declarative Programming: the program should accomplish without describing how to do it

- pseudocode: something that comes somewhere in between formatted English and computer program code, but is not runnable because certain details are ommitted.

## 1.2 Fundamental questions about algorithms
1. What is it supposed to do?
    - Specification: formalize the crucial details of the problem that the algorithm is intended        to solve
        - it will have to specify how the inputs and outputs of the algorithm are related, though           there is no general requirement that the specification is complete or non-ambiguous
2. Does it really do what it is supposed to do?
    - Verification: verifying whether the algorithm is indeed correct
3. How efficiently does it do it?
    - Performance analysis: the efficiency or performance of an algorithm relates to the                resources required by it, such as how quick it will run, or how many ram it will use.
