# Chapter 1: Introduction
## 1.1 Algorithms as opposed to programs
- algorithm:
a finite sequence of instructions, each of which has a clear meaning and can be performed with a finite amount of effort in a finite length of time
    - Imperative Programming: 
      computation in terms of instructions that change the program/data state
    - Declarative Programming:
      the program should accomplish without describing how to do it

- pseudocode:
  something that comes somewhere in between formatted English and computer program code, but is not runnable because certain details are ommitted.
