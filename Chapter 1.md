# Chapter 1: Introduction
## 1.1 Algorithms as opposed to programs
- algorithm:
a finite sequence of instructions, each of which has a clear meaning and can be performed with a finite amount of effort in a finite length of time
    - Imperative Programming: 
      computation in terms of instructions that change the program/data state
    - Declarative Programming:
      the program should accomplish without describing how to do it

- pseudocode:
  something that comes somewhere in between formatted English and computer program code, but is not runnable because certain details are ommitted.
## 1.2 Fundamental questions about algorithms
1. What is it supposed to do?
    Specification
2. Does it really do what it is supposed to do?
    Verification
3. How efficiently does it do it?
    Performance analysis
